          This plugin allows classic adlib music to be played; it has
          a built-in emulator so no actual adlib hardware (OPL2/3) is
          required. The plugin uses AdPlug for this which is also
          available as Winamp plugin.
          
     Installing:
          
          Simply copy the .dll file to the AGS editor folder. If
          everything is set up you can enable the plugin in the
          treeview.
          
     Usage:
          
          All functions can be accessed by using the static struct
          called AdPlug. Wen you type this in the script editor the
          autocompleter should give you enough hints of how it works.
          There is also a sample project which uses all features
          present in the plugin.
     
     Problems:

          In some cases the editor will not accept the .dll file and
          fails to load; for those cases there is an alternative .dll
          file available in the /msvcdll folder. I recommend swapping
          the dlls again for releases since the latter has not been
          tested enough.
    
     Notes:
          
          You are free to use the plugin in whatever way you want
          including in commercial projects. It would be nice to
          mention me in the credits but this is not required. This
          plugin makes use of two third-party libraries for which the
          licenses should be included in official releases; You will
          find them in the /docs folder.
          
          The plugin itself is licensed under the Zlib license.
          
          If you have any questions or comments please let me know.
          Have fun with it!
